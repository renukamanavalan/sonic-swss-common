/*
 * The eventd runs an event service that supports caching & miscellaneous
 * as required by events API.
 *
 * This header lists the services provided,
 * 
 * These services are only used by events API internally.
 *
 * All the services uses REQ/REP pattern between caller
 * centralized event service. The return code is provided
 * by service in its reply.
 *
 * event_request goes as single part message carrying event_req_t,
 * unless there is data associated.
 *
 * Both req & resp are either single or two part. In case of no
 * data associated, it is just request code or response return value in one part.
 * In case of data, it comes in seccond part.
 * 
 * Type of data is one or multiple strings, which is sent as serialized vector
 * of strings. event_serialized_lst_t
 *
 * In case of echo, part2 is the vector of single string as provided in the request.
 *
 * The cache-read returns cached events as vector of serialized strings.
 * NOTE: Cache only saves part 2 of the published event.
